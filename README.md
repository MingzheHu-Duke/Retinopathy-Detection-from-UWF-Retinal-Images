#  Deep learning approach for automated detection of retinal pathology from ultra-widefield retinal images
This study aims to develop a deep learning approach (Deep Residual Shrinkage Neural Network) that can automatically detect retinopathy in
ultra-widefield (UWF) retinal images with limited training data. It can serve as the steppingstone for large scale
deployment of real-time automated retinopathy detection tools using UWF images where no similar approach
has been developed.
